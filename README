## ⚙️ Requirements
The script works on most Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, ...). It requires the following commands to be available:
- `bash`
- `awk`
- `top`
- `free`
- `df`
- `ps`
- `uptime`
- `who`
- `lsb_release` (optional, for OS version)

> Note: To count failed login attempts, the script reads `/var/log/auth.log`.  
> You may need `sudo` privileges depending on your system configuration.

## 🚦 Color Legend
The script uses color-coded output to indicate system health:

- 🟢 **Green** → Normal (≤ 50%)  
- 🟡 **Yellow** → Warning (51–80%)  
- 🔴 **Red** → Critical (> 80%)  

This applies to **CPU**, **memory**, and **disk** usage.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Save the script as `server-stats.sh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x server-stats.sh
